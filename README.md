#### Project Title: Predictive Analytics for Enhanced Customer Experience and Risk Management in Insurance

#### Project Overview:
- Our aim with this project is to develop a comprehensive framework for multi-predictive modeling using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to build and compare multiple prediction models, each tailored to understand different aspects of the dataset. We will conduct a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and gain insights that will inform model development. The project seeks to enhance forecasting accuracy and provide robust decision-making tools across different scenarios through the integration of diverse modeling approaches.


##### Objectives:
- The purpose of this project is to determine which policyholders, based on their policy interaction history, policy details and claim history are likely to have a favorable experience.The goal is be able to make a model that can actively proactively provide individualized services.
- The second objective of this project to use predictive analytics to predict total claims.
- The reason we are doing this to see explore different insight to fraud mechanism
